During the summit, we will have breakout rooms during which some of us will be interviewing community members about their ideas and preferences. At the end of the summit, we will be putting together public recommendations that k-12 public schools will be using to determine how they will or won't use AI in their processes."

      "response": "We need to know the general preferences (hopes, concerns) that the public, especially people who work in k-12 or people who have children in or entering k-12 education, has about the use of AI in education. We already know from prior surveys that people in our community are very concerned with this issue, especially the use of AI to write essays for students, but there are still a lot of unknowns otherwise, and we get the sense that our community has a lot of other concerns that we haven't had a chance to understand yet."

      "response": "Students, teachers, and parents will be primarily affected by the outcome of the decision here. In a less direct way, the broader workforce will be affected, because education has long-term implications for workforce training and efficacy. For example, parents around here seem to be concerned about the use of AI to augment or replace student work, which might leave students less prepared to handle necessary tasks in the workplace, given whatever profession they might end up in, but especially work that might involve reading, writing, and data analysis."
